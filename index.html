    <h1>Dear Internet,</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
    I have to say I never really <i>used</i> the internet until this past year. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had used social media. You know 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instagram</a>,
      <a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube</a>,
      <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chatgpt</a>,
      whatever. And I had done programming before, but only on my local machine. I never realized how fulfilling, but also how <i>easy</i> it would be to put a website on the internet. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not here to flex my websites or anything... honestly <a href="claude.ai" targer="_blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">claude</a> deserves more credit than me for coding them up... but. The internet (or the <i>web</i>) is genuinely the best place to create and share stuff. it's honestly crazy that our whole generation was psyopped into thinking that the only way to share <i>literally anything</i> was on closed platforms...

      I've always wanted to be an artist. So I just want to say I appreciate you, "The Internet." You are the one canvas that I'm not that bad at painting on.
